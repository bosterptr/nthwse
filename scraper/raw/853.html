												<p><strong>Microsoft</strong> today released updates to fix more than 50 security vulnerabilities in <strong>Windows</strong> and related software, a relatively light Patch Tuesday this month for Windows users. The software giant also responded to a torrent of negative feedback on a new feature of Redmond’s flagship operating system that constantly takes screenshots of whatever users are doing on their computers, saying the feature would no longer be enabled by default.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-56287" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/windupate.png" alt="" width="749" height="527" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/windupate.png 841w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/windupate-768x541.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/windupate-782x550.png 782w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/windupate-100x70.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px"></p>
<p>Last month, Microsoft debuted <strong>Copilot+ PCs</strong>, an AI-enabled version of Windows. Copilot+ ships with a feature nobody asked for that Redmond has aptly dubbed <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/retrace-your-steps-with-recall-aa03f8a0-a78b-4b3e-b0a1-2eb8ac48701c" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Recall</strong></a>, which constantly takes screenshots of what the user is doing on their PC. Security experts roundly trashed Recall as a fancy keylogger, noting that it would be a gold mine of information for attackers if the user’s PC was compromised with malware.</p>
<p>Microsoft countered that Recall snapshots never leave the user’s system, and that even if attackers managed to hack a Copilot+ PC they would not be able to exfiltrate on-device Recall data. But that claim rang hollow after former Microsoft threat analyst <strong>Kevin Beaumont</strong> <a href="https://doublepulsar.com/recall-stealing-everything-youve-ever-typed-or-viewed-on-your-own-windows-pc-is-now-possible-da3e12e9465e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detailed on his blog</a> how any user on the system (even a non-administrator) can export Recall data, which is just stored in an SQLite database locally.</p>
<p>“I’m not being hyperbolic when I say this is the dumbest cybersecurity move in a decade,” Beaumont <a href="https://cyberplace.social/@GossiTheDog/112535509953161486" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said on Mastodon</a>.</p>
<p>In a recent <a href="https://risky.biz/RB750/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Risky Business podcast</a>, host <strong>Patrick Gray</strong> noted that the screenshots created and indexed by Recall would be a boon to any attacker who suddenly finds himself in an unfamiliar environment.</p>
<p>“The first thing you want to do when you get on a machine if you’re up to no good is to figure out how someone did their job,” Gray said. “We saw that in the case of the SWIFT attacks against central banks years ago. Attackers had to do screen recordings to figure out how transfers work. And this could speed up that sort of discovery process.”</p>
<p>Responding to the withering criticism of Recall, Microsoft <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2024/06/07/update-on-the-recall-preview-feature-for-copilot-pcs/?ref=news.risky.biz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said last week</a> that it will no longer be enabled by default on Copilot+ PCs. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/06/patch-tuesday-june-2024-recall-edition/#more-67754" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">→</span></a></p>

												<p>Law enforcement agencies in the United States and Europe today announced <strong>Operation Endgame</strong>, a coordinated action against some of the most popular cybercrime platforms for delivering ransomware and data-stealing malware. Dubbed “the largest ever operation against botnets,” the international effort is being billed as the opening salvo in an ongoing campaign targeting advanced malware “droppers” or “loaders” like&nbsp;<strong>IcedID</strong>, <strong>Smokeloader</strong> and <strong>Trickbot</strong>.</p>
<div id="attachment_67699" style="width: 759px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-67699" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-67699" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/endgamestill.png" alt="" width="749" height="678" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/endgamestill.png 998w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/endgamestill-768x696.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/endgamestill-782x708.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px"><p id="caption-attachment-67699" class="wp-caption-text">A frame from one of three animated videos released today in connection with Operation Endgame.</p></div>
<p>Operation Endgame targets the cybercrime ecosystem supporting droppers/loaders, slang terms used to describe tiny, custom-made programs designed to surreptitiously install malware onto a target system. Droppers are typically used in the initial stages of a breach, and they allow cybercriminals to bypass security measures and deploy additional harmful programs, including viruses, ransomware, or spyware.</p>
<p>Droppers like IcedID are most often deployed through email attachments, hacked websites, or bundled with legitimate software. For example, cybercriminals have long used <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/01/using-google-search-to-find-software-can-be-risky/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paid ads on Google to trick people into installing malware</a> disguised as popular free software, such as Microsoft Teams, Adobe Reader and Discord. In those cases, the dropper is the hidden component bundled with the legitimate software that quietly loads malware onto the user’s system.</p>
<p>Droppers remain such a critical, human-intensive component of nearly all major cybercrime enterprises that the most popular have turned into full-fledged cybercrime services of their own. By targeting the individuals who develop and maintain dropper services and their supporting infrastructure, authorities are hoping to disrupt multiple cybercriminal operations simultaneously.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/largest-ever-operation-against-botnets-hits-dropper-malware-ecosystem" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a statement</a> from the European police agency <strong>Europol</strong>, between May 27 and May 29, 2024 authorities arrested four suspects (one in Armenia and three in Ukraine), and disrupted or took down more than 100 Internet servers in Bulgaria, Canada, Germany, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Romania, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, United States and Ukraine. Authorities say they also seized more than 2,000 domain names that supported dropper infrastructure online.</p>
<p>In addition, Europol released information on eight fugitives suspected of involvement in dropper services and who are wanted by Germany; their names and photos were added to Europol’s “Most Wanted” list on 30 May 2024. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/05/operation-endgame-hits-malware-delivery-platforms/#more-67691" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">→</span></a></p>

												<p>The <strong>U.S. Department of Justice</strong> (DOJ) today said they arrested the alleged operator of <strong>911 S5</strong>, a ten-year-old online anonymity service that was powered by what the director of the FBI called “likely the world’s largest botnet ever.” The arrest coincided with the seizure of the 911 S5 website and supporting infrastructure, which the government says turned computers running various “free VPN” products into Internet traffic relays that facilitated billions of dollars in online fraud and cybercrime.</p>
<div id="attachment_67662" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-67662" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-67662" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cloudrouter.png" alt="" width="750" height="407" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cloudrouter.png 838w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cloudrouter-768x417.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cloudrouter-782x425.png 782w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cloudrouter-370x200.png 370w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"><p id="caption-attachment-67662" class="wp-caption-text">The Cloud Router homepage, which was seized by the FBI this past weekend. Cloud Router was previously called 911 S5.</p></div>
<p>On May 24, authorities in Singapore arrested the alleged creator and operator of 911 S5, a 35-year-old Chinese national named <strong>YunHe Wang</strong>. In a statement on his arrest today, the DOJ said 911 S5 enabled cybercriminals to bypass financial fraud detection systems and steal billions of dollars from financial institutions, credit card issuers, and federal lending programs.</p>
<p>For example, the government estimates that 560,000 fraudulent unemployment insurance claims originated from compromised Internet addresses, resulting in a confirmed fraudulent loss exceeding $5.9 billion.</p>
<p>“Additionally, in evaluating suspected fraud loss to the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program, the United States estimates that more than 47,000 EIDL applications originated from IP addresses compromised by 911 S5,” the DOJ <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/911-s5-botnet-dismantled-and-its-administrator-arrested-coordinated-international-operation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>. “Millions of dollars more were similarly identified by financial institutions in the United States as loss originating from IP addresses compromised by 911 S5.”</p>
<p>From 2015 to July 2022, 911 S5 sold access to hundreds of thousands of <strong>Microsoft Windows</strong> computers daily, as “proxies” that allowed customers to route their Internet traffic through PCs in virtually any country or city around the globe — but predominantly in the United States.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-31323" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/proxy.png" alt="" width="748" height="313"></p>
<p>911 S5 built its proxy network mainly by offering “free” virtual private networking (VPN) services. 911’s VPN performed largely as advertised for the user — allowing them to surf the web anonymously — but it also quietly turned the user’s computer into a traffic relay for paying 911 S5 customers.</p>
<p>911 S5’s reliability and extremely low prices quickly made it one of the most popular services among denizens of the cybercrime underground, and the service became almost shorthand for connecting to that “last mile” of cybercrime. Namely, the ability to route one’s malicious traffic through a computer that is geographically close to the consumer whose stolen credit card is about to be used, or whose bank account is about to be emptied.</p>
<div id="attachment_60398" style="width: 759px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-60398" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-60398" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/s5prices.png" alt="" width="749" height="429" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/s5prices.png 1230w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/s5prices-768x440.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/s5prices-782x448.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px"><p id="caption-attachment-60398" class="wp-caption-text">The prices page for 911 S5, circa July 2022. $28 would let users cycle through 150 proxies on this popular service.</p></div>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity first identified Mr. Wang as the proprietor of the popular service in <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/07/a-deep-dive-into-the-residential-proxy-service-911/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a deep dive on 911 S5 published in July 2022</a>. That story showed that 911 S5 had a history of paying people to install its software by secretly bundling it with other software — including fake security updates for common programs like Flash Player, and “cracked” or pirated commercial software distributed on file-sharing networks.</p>
<p>Ten days later, 911 S5 closed up shop, <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/07/911-proxy-service-implodes-after-disclosing-breach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claiming it had been hacked</a>. But experts soon tracked <a href="https://spur.us/cloudrouter-911-proxy-resurrected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the reemergence of the proxy network</a> by another name: <strong>Cloud Router</strong>.</p>
<p>The announcement of Wang’s arrest came less than 24 hours after the <strong>U.S. Department of the Treasury</strong> <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/05/treasury-sanctions-creators-of-911-s5-proxy-botnet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sanctioned Wang and two associates</a>, as well as several companies the men allegedly used to launder the nearly $100 million in proceeds from 911 S5 and Cloud Router customers.</p>
<p>Cloud Router’s homepage now features a notice saying the domain has been <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1353521/dl?inline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seized by the U.S. government</a>. In addition, the DOJ says it worked with authorities in Singapore, Thailand and Germany to search residences tied to the defendant, and seized approximately $30 million in assets.</p>
<div id="attachment_67681" style="width: 759px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-67681" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-67681" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cloudrouterseized.png" alt="" width="749" height="453" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cloudrouterseized.png 1375w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cloudrouterseized-768x464.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cloudrouterseized-782x473.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px"><p id="caption-attachment-67681" class="wp-caption-text">The Cloud Router homepage now features a seizure notice from the FBI in multiple languages.</p></div>
<p>Those assets included a 2022 Ferrari F8 Spider S-A, a BMW i8, a BMW X7 M50d, a Rolls Royce, more than a dozen domestic and international bank accounts, over two dozen cryptocurrency wallets, several luxury wristwatches, and 21 residential or investment properties. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/05/is-your-computer-part-of-the-largest-botnet-ever/#more-67679" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">→</span></a></p>

												<p><strong>The U.S. Department of the Treasury</strong> today unveiled sanctions against three Chinese nationals for allegedly operating <strong>911 S5</strong>, an online anonymity service that for many years was the easiest and cheapest way to route one’s Web traffic through malware-infected computers around the globe.

<p>That story named <strong>Yunhe Wang</strong> from Beijing as the apparent owner or manager of the 911 S5 proxy service. In today’s Treasury action, Mr. Wang was named as the primary administrator of the botnet that powered 911 S5.</p>
<p>“A review of records from network infrastructure service providers known to be utilized by 911 S5 and two Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) specific to the botnet operation (MaskVPN and DewVPN) showed Yunhe Wang as the registered subscriber to those providers’ services,” reads <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2375" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Treasury announcement</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update, May 29, 12:26 p.m. ET: </strong><strong>The U.S. Department of Justice</strong> (DOJ) just announced they have arrested Wang in connection with the 911 S5 botnet. The DOJ says 911 S5 customers have stolen billions of dollars from financial institutions, credit card issuers, and federal lending programs.</p>
<p>“911 S5 customers allegedly targeted certain pandemic relief programs,” <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/911-s5-botnet-dismantled-and-its-administrator-arrested-coordinated-international-operation" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a DOJ statement</a> on the arrest reads. “For example, the United States estimates that 560,000 fraudulent unemployment insurance claims originated from compromised IP addresses, resulting in a confirmed fraudulent loss exceeding $5.9 billion. Additionally, in evaluating suspected fraud loss to the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program, the United States estimates that more than 47,000 EIDL applications originated from IP addresses compromised by 911 S5. Millions of dollars more were similarly identified by financial institutions in the United States as loss originating from IP addresses compromised by 911 S5.”</p>
<p>The sanctions say <strong>Jingping Liu</strong> was Yunhe Wang’s co-conspirator in the laundering of criminally derived proceeds generated from 911 S5, mainly virtual currency. The government alleges the virtual currencies paid by 911 S5 users were converted into U.S. dollars using over-the-counter vendors who wired and deposited funds into bank accounts held by Liu.</p>
<p>“Jingping Liu assisted Yunhe Wang by laundering criminally derived proceeds through bank accounts held in her name that were then utilized to purchase luxury real estate properties for Yunhe Wang,” the document continues. “These individuals leveraged their malicious botnet technology to compromise personal devices, enabling cybercriminals to fraudulently secure economic assistance intended for those in need and to terrorize our citizens with bomb threats.” <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/05/treasury-sanctions-creators-of-911-s5-proxy-botnet/#more-67661" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">→</span></a></p>

<p>Two weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, a large, mysterious new Internet hosting firm called <strong>Stark Industries Solutions</strong> materialized and quickly became the epicenter of massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on government and commercial targets in Ukraine and Europe. An investigation into Stark Industries reveals it is being used as a global proxy network that conceals the true source of cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns against enemies of Russia.</p>
<p>At least a dozen patriotic Russian hacking groups have been launching DDoS attacks since the start of the war at a variety of targets seen as opposed to Moscow. But by all accounts, few attacks from those gangs have come close to the amount of firepower wielded by a pro-Russia group calling itself “<strong>NoName057(16)</strong>.”</p>
<div id="attachment_67469" style="width: 761px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-67469" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-67469" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/netscout-hacktivist-ddos.png" alt="" width="751" height="442" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/netscout-hacktivist-ddos.png 996w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/netscout-hacktivist-ddos-768x452.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/netscout-hacktivist-ddos-782x460.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px"><p id="caption-attachment-67469" class="wp-caption-text">This graphic comes from a recent report from NETSCOUT about DDoS attacks from Russian hacktivist groups.</p></div>
<p>As detailed by researchers at <a href="https://www.radware.com/security/threat-advisories-and-attack-reports/hacktivism-unveiled-april-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Radware</a>, NoName has effectively gamified DDoS attacks, <a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/noname05716-the-pro-russian-hacktivist-group-targeting-nato/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recruiting hacktivists</a> via its Telegram channel and offering to pay people who agree to install a piece of software called <strong>DDoSia</strong>. That program allows NoName to commandeer the host computers and their Internet connections in coordinated DDoS campaigns, and DDoSia users with the most attacks can win cash prizes.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.team-cymru.com/post/a-blog-with-noname" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> from the security firm <strong>Team Cymru</strong> found the DDoS attack infrastructure used in NoName campaigns is assigned to two interlinked hosting providers: <strong>MIRhosting</strong> and <strong>Stark Industries</strong>. MIRhosting is a hosting provider founded in The Netherlands in 2004. But <a href="https://bgp.he.net/AS44477" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stark Industries Solutions Ltd</a> was incorporated on February 10, 2022, just two weeks before the Russian invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<h2>PROXY WARS</h2>
<p>Security experts say that not long after the war started, Stark began hosting dozens of proxy services and free virtual private networking (VPN) services, which are designed to help users shield their Internet usage and location from prying eyes.</p>
<p>Proxy providers allow users to route their Internet and Web browsing traffic through someone else’s computer. From a website’s perspective, the traffic from a proxy network user appears to originate from the rented IP address, not from the proxy service customer.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-31323" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/proxy.png" alt="" width="600" height="251"></p>
<p>These services can be used in a legitimate manner for several business purposes — such as price comparisons or sales intelligence — but they are also massively abused for hiding cybercrime activity because they can make it difficult to trace malicious traffic to its original source.</p>
<p>What’s more, many proxy services do not disclose how they obtain access to the proxies they are renting out, and in many cases the access is obtained through the dissemination of malicious software that turns the infected system into a traffic relay — usually unbeknownst to the legitimate owner of the Internet connection. Other proxy services will allow users to make money by renting out their Internet connection to anyone.</p>
<p><a href="https://spur.us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spur.us</a> is a company that tracks VPNs and proxy services worldwide. Spur finds that Stark Industries (AS44477) currently is home to at least 74 VPN services, and 40 different proxy services. As we’ll see in the final section of this story, just one of those proxy networks has over a million Internet addresses&nbsp;available for rent across the globe.</p>
<p><strong>Raymond Dijkxhoorn</strong> operates a hosting firm in The Netherlands called <a href="https://www.prolocation.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prolocation</a>. He also co-runs <a href="https://www.surbl.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SURBL</a>, an anti-abuse service that flags domains and Internet address ranges that are strongly associated with spam and cybercrime activity, including DDoS.</p>
<p>Dijkxhoorn said last year SURBL heard from multiple people who said they operated VPN services whose web resources were included in SURBL’s block lists.</p>
<p>“We had people doing delistings at SURBL for domain names that were suspended by the registrars,” Dijkhoorn told KrebsOnSecurity. “And at least two of them explained that Stark offered them free VPN services that they were reselling.”</p>
<p>Dijkxhoorn added that Stark Industries also sponsored activist groups from Ukraine.</p>
<p>“How valuable would it be for Russia to know the real IPs from Ukraine’s tech warriors?” he observed. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/05/stark-industries-solutions-an-iron-hammer-in-the-cloud/#more-66304" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">→</span></a></p>

<p><strong>Apple</strong> and the satellite-based broadband service <strong>Starlink</strong> each recently took steps to address new research into the potential security and privacy implications of how their services geo-locate devices. Researchers from the <strong>University of Maryland</strong> say they relied on publicly available data from Apple to track the location of billions of devices globally — including non-Apple devices like Starlink systems — and found they could use this data to monitor the destruction of Gaza, as well as the movements and in many cases identities of Russian and Ukrainian troops.</p>
<p>At issue is the way that Apple collects and publicly shares information about the precise location of all Wi-Fi access points seen by its devices. Apple collects this location data to give Apple devices a crowdsourced, low-power alternative to constantly requesting global positioning system (GPS) coordinates.</p>
<p>Both Apple and<strong> Google</strong> operate their own <strong>Wi-Fi-based Positioning Systems</strong> (WPS) that obtain certain hardware identifiers from all wireless access points that come within range of their mobile devices. Both record the <strong>Media Access Control</strong> (MAC) address that a Wi-FI access point uses, known as a <strong>Basic Service Set Identifier</strong> or <strong>BSSID</strong>.</p>
<p>Periodically, Apple and Google mobile devices will forward their locations — by querying GPS and/or by using cellular towers as landmarks — along with any nearby BSSIDs. This combination of data allows Apple and Google devices to figure out where they are within a few feet or meters, and it’s what allows your mobile phone to continue displaying your planned route even when the device can’t get a fix on GPS.</p>
<p>With Google’s WPS, a wireless device submits a list of nearby Wi-Fi access point BSSIDs and their signal strengths — via an <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/api/what-is-an-api/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">application programming interface</a> (API) request to Google — whose WPS responds with the device’s computed position. Google’s WPS requires at least two BSSIDs to calculate a device’s approximate position.</p>
<p>Apple’s WPS also accepts a list of nearby BSSIDs, but instead of computing the device’s location based off the set of observed access points and their received signal strengths and then reporting that result to the user, Apple’s API <em>will return the geolocations of up to 400 hundred more BSSIDs that are nearby the one requested</em>. It then uses approximately eight of those BSSIDs to work out the user’s location based on known landmarks.</p>
<p>In essence, Google’s WPS computes the user’s location and shares it with the device. Apple’s WPS gives its devices a large enough amount of data about the location of known access points in the area that the devices can do that estimation on their own.</p>
<p>That’s according to two researchers at the University of Maryland, who theorized they could use the verbosity of Apple’s API to map the movement of individual devices into and out of virtually any defined area of the world. The UMD pair said they spent a month early in their research continuously querying the API, asking it for the location of more than a billion BSSIDs generated at random.</p>
<p>They learned that while only about three million of those randomly generated BSSIDs were known to Apple’s Wi-Fi geolocation API, <em>Apple also returned an additional 488 million BSSID locations already stored in its WPS from other lookups</em>.</p>
<p><strong>UMD Associate Professor David Levin</strong> and Ph.D student <strong>Erik Rye</strong> found they could mostly avoid requesting unallocated BSSIDs by consulting the list of BSSID ranges assigned to specific device manufacturers. <a href="https://standards-oui.ieee.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">That list</a> is maintained by the <strong>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers</strong> (IEEE), which is also sponsoring <a href="https://sp2024.ieee-security.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the privacy and security conference</a> where Rye is slated to present the UMD research later today.</p>
<p>Plotting the locations returned by Apple’s WPS between November 2022 and November 2023, Levin and Rye saw they had a near global view of the locations tied to more than two billion Wi-Fi access points. The map showed geolocated access points in nearly every corner of the globe, apart from almost the entirety of China, vast stretches of desert wilderness in central Australia and Africa, and deep in the rainforests of South America.</p>

<p>The researchers said that by zeroing in on or “geofencing” other smaller regions indexed by Apple’s location API, they could monitor how Wi-Fi access points moved over time. Why might that be a big deal? They found that by geofencing active conflict zones in Ukraine, they were able to determine the location and movement of Starlink devices used by both Ukrainian and Russian forces.</p>
<p>The reason they were able to do that is that each Starlink terminal — the dish and associated hardware that allows a Starlink customer to receive Internet service from a constellation of orbiting Starlink satellites — includes its own Wi-Fi access point, whose location is going to be automatically indexed by any nearby Apple devices that have location services enabled.</p>

Image: UMD.</p></div>
<p>The University of Maryland team geo-fenced various conflict zones in Ukraine, and identified at least 3,722 Starlink terminals geolocated in Ukraine.</p>
<p>“We find what appear to be personal devices being brought by military personnel into war zones, exposing pre-deployment sites and military positions,” the researchers wrote. “Our results also show individuals who have left Ukraine to a wide range of countries, validating public reports of where Ukrainian refugees have resettled.”</p>
<p>In an interview with KrebsOnSecurity, the UMD team said they found that in addition to exposing Russian troop pre-deployment sites, the location data made it easy to see where devices in contested regions originated from.</p>
<p>“This includes residential addresses throughout the world,” Levin said. “We even believe we can identify people who have joined the Ukraine Foreign Legion.”</p>

												<p><strong>Microsoft</strong> today released updates to fix more than 60 security holes in <strong>Windows</strong> computers and supported software, including two “zero-day” vulnerabilities in Windows that are already being exploited in active attacks. There are also important security patches available for <strong>macOS</strong> and <strong>Adobe</strong> users, and for the <strong>Chrome</strong> Web browser, which just patched its own zero-day flaw.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-60331" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/winupdatedate.png" alt="" width="749" height="496" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/winupdatedate.png 923w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/winupdatedate-768x508.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/winupdatedate-782x518.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px"></p>
<p>First, the zero-days. <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2024-30051" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2024-30051</a> is an “elevation of privilege” bug in a core Windows library. <strong>Satnam Narang</strong> at <strong>Tenable</strong> said this flaw is being used as part of post-compromise activity to elevate privileges as a local attacker.</p>
<p>“CVE-2024-30051 is used to gain initial access into a target environment and requires the use of social engineering tactics via email, social media or instant messaging to convince a target to open a specially crafted document file,” Narang said. “Once exploited, the attacker can bypass OLE mitigations in Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Office, which are security features designed to protect end users from malicious files.”</p>
<p><strong>Kaspersky Lab</strong>, one of two companies credited with reporting exploitation of CVE-2024-30051 to Microsoft, has published <a href="https://securelist.com/cve-2024-30051/112618/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a fascinating writeup</a> on how they discovered the exploit in a file shared with Virustotal.com.</p>
<p>Kaspersky said it has since seen the exploit used together with <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/08/u-s-hacks-qakbot-quietly-removes-botnet-infections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QakBot</a> and other malware. Emerging in 2007 as a banking trojan, QakBot (a.k.a.&nbsp;<strong>Qbot</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Pinkslipbot</strong>) has morphed into an advanced malware strain now used by multiple cybercriminal groups to prepare newly compromised networks for ransomware infestations.</p>
<p><a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2024-30040" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2024-30040</a> is a security feature bypass in <strong>MSHTML</strong>, a component that is deeply tied to the default Web browser on Windows systems. Microsoft’s advisory on this flaw is fairly sparse, but <strong>Kevin Breen</strong> from <strong>Immersive Labs</strong> said this vulnerability also affects <strong>Office 365</strong> and <strong>Microsoft Office</strong> applications.</p>
<p>“Very little information is provided and the short description is painfully obtuse,” Breen said of Microsoft’s advisory on CVE-2024-30040.</p>

												<p>Last week, the United States joined the U.K. and Australia in sanctioning and charging a Russian man named <strong>Dmitry Yuryevich Khoroshev</strong> as the leader of the infamous <strong>LockBit</strong> ransomware group. LockBit’s leader “<strong>LockBitSupp</strong>” claims the feds named the wrong guy, saying the charges don’t explain how they connected him to Khoroshev. This post examines the activities of Khoroshev’s many alter egos on the cybercrime forums, and tracks the career of a gifted malware author who has written and sold malicious code for the past 14 years.</p>
<div id="attachment_67453" style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-67453" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-67453" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/khoroshev-sq.png" alt="" width="250" height="255"><p id="caption-attachment-67453" class="wp-caption-text">Dmitry Yuryevich Khoroshev. Image: treasury.gov.</p></div>
<p>On May 7, the U.S. Department of Justice <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1350921/dl?inline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">indicted</a> Khoroshev on 26 criminal counts, including extortion, wire fraud, and conspiracy. The government alleges Khoroshev created, sold and used the LockBit ransomware strain to personally extort more than $100 million from hundreds of victim organizations, and that LockBit as a group extorted roughly half a billion dollars over four years.</p>
<p>Federal investigators say Khoroshev ran LockBit as a “<strong>ransomware-as-a-service</strong>” operation, wherein he kept 20 percent of any ransom amount paid by a victim organization infected with his code, with the remaining 80 percent of the payment going to LockBit affiliates responsible for spreading the malware.</p>
<p>Financial <a href="https://ofac.treasury.gov/recent-actions/20240507" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sanctions levied against Khoroshev</a> by the <strong>U.S. Department of the Treasury</strong> listed his known email and street address (in Voronezh, in southwest Russia), passport number, and even his tax ID number (hello, Russian tax authorities). The Treasury filing says Khoroshev used the emails <strong>sitedev5@yandex.ru</strong>, and <strong>khoroshev1@icloud.com</strong>.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.domaintools.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DomainTools.com</a>, the address sitedev5@yandex.ru was used to register at least six domains, including a Russian business registered in Khoroshev’s name called <strong>tkaner.com</strong>, which is a blog about clothing and fabrics.</p>
<p>A search at the breach-tracking service <a href="https://constella.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Constella Intelligence</a> on the phone number in Tkaner’s registration records&nbsp; — <strong>7.9521020220</strong> — brings up multiple official Russian government documents listing the number’s owner as Dmitri Yurievich Khoroshev.</p>
<p>Another domain registered to that phone number was <strong>stairwell[.]ru</strong>, which at one point advertised the sale of wooden staircases. Constella finds that the email addresses webmaster@stairwell.ru and admin@stairwell.ru used the password <strong>225948</strong>.</p>
<p>DomainTools reports that stairwell.ru for several years included the registrant’s name as “<strong>Dmitrij Ju Horoshev</strong>,” and the email address <strong>pin@darktower.su</strong>. According to Constella, this email address was used in 2010 to register an account for a Dmitry Yurievich Khoroshev from Voronezh, Russia at the hosting provider <strong>firstvds.ru</strong>.</p>

<p>Cyber intelligence firm <a href="https://www.intel471.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intel 471</a> finds that pin@darktower.ru was used by a Russian-speaking member called Pin on the English-language cybercrime forum <b>Opensc. </b>Pin was active on Opensc around March 2012, and authored 13 posts that mostly concerned data encryption issues, or how to fix bugs in code.</p>
<p>Other posts concerned custom code Pin claimed to have written that would bypass memory protections on Windows XP and Windows 7 systems, and inject malware into memory space normally allocated to trusted applications on a Windows machine.</p>
<p>Pin also was active at that same time on the Russian-language security forum <b>Antichat</b>, where they told fellow forum members to contact them at the ICQ instant messenger number <strong>669316</strong>.</p>
<h2>NEROWOLFE</h2>
<p>A search on the ICQ number 669316 at Intel 471 shows that in April 2011, a user by the name <strong>NeroWolfe</strong> joined the Russian cybercrime forum <strong>Zloy</strong> using the email address <strong>d.horoshev@gmail.com</strong>, and from an Internet address in Voronezh, RU.</p>
<p>Constella finds the same password tied to webmaster@stairwell.ru (225948) was used by the email address <strong>3k@xakep.ru</strong>, which Intel 471 says was registered to more than a dozen NeroWolfe accounts across just as many Russian cybercrime forums between 2011 and 2015.</p>
<p>NeroWolfe’s introductory post to the forum <strong>Verified</strong> in Oct. 2011 said he was a system administrator and C++ coder.</p>
<p>“Installing SpyEYE, ZeuS, any DDoS and spam admin panels,” NeroWolfe wrote. This user said they specialize in developing malware, creating computer worms, and crafting new ways to hijack Web browsers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-53514" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ransomware.png" alt="" width="750" height="562" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ransomware.png 1016w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ransomware-768x575.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"></p>
<p>“I can provide my portfolio on request,” NeroWolfe wrote. “P.S. I don’t modify someone else’s code or work with someone else’s frameworks.”</p>
<p>In April 2013, NeroWolfe wrote in a private message to another Verified forum user that he was selling a malware “loader” program that could bypass all of the security protections on Windows XP and Windows 7.</p>
<p>“The access to the network is slightly restricted,” NeroWolfe said of the loader, which he was selling for $5,000. “You won’t manage to bind a port. However, it’s quite possible to send data. The code is written in C.”</p>
<p>In an October 2013 discussion on the cybercrime forum <strong>Exploit</strong>, NeroWolfe weighed in on the karmic ramifications of ransomware. At the time, ransomware-as-a-service didn’t exist yet, and many members of Exploit were still making good money from “lockers,” relatively crude programs that locked the user out of their system until they agreed to make a small payment (usually a few hundred dollars via prepaid Green Dot cards).</p>
<p>Lockers, which presaged the coming ransomware scourge, were generally viewed by the Russian-speaking cybercrime forums as harmless moneymaking opportunities, because they usually didn’t seek to harm the host computer or endanger files on the system. Also, there were still plenty of locker programs that aspiring cybercriminals could either buy or rent to make a steady income.</p>
<p>NeroWolfe reminded forum denizens that they were just as vulnerable to ransomware attacks as their would-be victims, and that what goes around comes around.</p>
<p>“Guys, do you have a conscience?,” NeroWolfe wrote. “Okay, lockers, network gopstop aka business in Russian. The last thing was always squeezed out of the suckers. But encoders, no one is protected from them, including the local audience.” <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/05/how-did-authorities-identify-the-alleged-lockbit-boss/#more-67396" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">→</span></a></p>

												<p>The United States joined the United Kingdom and Australia today in sanctioning 31-year-old Russian national <strong>Dmitry Yuryevich Khoroshev</strong> as the alleged leader of the infamous ransomware group <strong>LockBit</strong>. The <strong>U.S. Department of Justice</strong> also indicted Khoroshev and charged him with using Lockbit to attack more than 2,000 victims and extort at least $100 million in ransomware payments.</p>

<p>Khoroshev (Дмитрий Юрьевич Хорошев), a resident of Voronezh, Russia, was charged in <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1350921/dl?inline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 26-count indictment</a> by a grand jury in New Jersey.</p>
<p>“Dmitry Khoroshev conceived, developed, and administered Lockbit, the most prolific ransomware variant and group in the world, enabling himself and his affiliates to wreak havoc and cause billions of dollars in damage to thousands of victims around the globe,” <strong>U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger</strong> said in <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-charges-russian-national-developing-and-operating-lockbit-ransomware" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a statement</a> released by the Justice Department.</p>
<p>The indictment alleges Khoroshev acted as the LockBit ransomware group’s developer and administrator from its inception in September 2019 through May 2024, and that he typically received a 20 percent share of each ransom payment extorted from LockBit victims.</p>
<p>The government says LockBit victims included individuals, small businesses, multinational corporations, hospitals, schools, nonprofit organizations, critical infrastructure, and government and law-enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>“Khoroshev and his co-conspirators extracted at least $500 million in ransom payments from their victims and caused billions of dollars in broader losses, such as lost revenue, incident response, and recovery,” the DOJ said. “The LockBit ransomware group attacked more than 2,500 victims in at least 120 countries, including 1,800 victims in the United States.”</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/lockbit-leader-unmasked-and-sanctioned" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unmasking of LockBitSupp</a> comes nearly three months after U.S. and U.K. authorities seized the darknet websites run by LockBit, retrofitting it with press releases about the law enforcement action and <a href="https://www.nomoreransom.org/en/decryption-tools.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free tools</a> to help LockBit victims decrypt infected systems.</p>
<div id="attachment_66436" style="width: 759px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-66436" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-66436" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/lockbitseized.png" alt="" width="749" height="474" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/lockbitseized.png 1379w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/lockbitseized-768x486.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/lockbitseized-782x494.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px"><p id="caption-attachment-66436" class="wp-caption-text">The feds used the existing design on LockBit’s victim shaming website to feature press releases and free decryption tools.</p></div>
<p>One of the blog captions that authorities left on the seized site was a teaser page that read, “Who is LockbitSupp?,” which promised to reveal the true identity of the ransomware group leader. That item featured a countdown clock until the big reveal, but when the site’s timer expired no such details were offered.</p>
<p>Following the FBI’s raid, LockBitSupp took to Russian cybercrime forums to assure his partners and affiliates that the ransomware operation was still fully operational. LockBitSupp also raised another set of darknet websites that soon promised to release data stolen from a number of LockBit victims ransomed prior to the FBI raid.</p>
<p>One of the victims LockBitSupp continued extorting was Fulton County, Ga. Following the FBI raid, LockbitSupp <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/03/blackcat-ransomware-group-implodes-after-apparent-22m-ransom-payment-by-change-healthcare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vowed to release sensitive documents stolen from the county court system</a> unless paid a ransom demand before LockBit’s countdown timer expired. But when Fulton County officials <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/02/fulton-county-security-experts-call-lockbits-bluff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refused to pay</a> and the timer expired, no stolen records were ever published. Experts said it was likely the FBI had in fact seized all of LockBit’s stolen data.</p>
<p>LockBitSupp also bragged that their real identity would never be revealed, and at one point offered to pay $10 million to anyone who could discover their real name.</p>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity has been in intermittent contact with LockBitSupp for several months over the course of reporting on different LockBit victims. Reached at the same ToX instant messenger identity that the ransomware group leader has promoted on Russian cybercrime forums, LockBitSupp claimed the authorities named the wrong guy.</p>
<blockquote class="pullquote pqRight"><p>“It’s not me,” LockBitSupp replied in Russian. “I don’t understand how the FBI was able to connect me with this poor guy.</p></blockquote><p><span class="pullquote pqright">“It’s not me,” LockBitSupp replied in Russian. “I don’t understand how the FBI was able to connect me with this poor guy.</span> Where is the logical chain that it is me? Don’t you feel sorry for a random innocent person?”</p>
<p>LockBitSupp, who now has a $10 million bounty for his arrest from the <strong>U.S. Department of State</strong>, has been known to be flexible with the truth. The Lockbit group routinely practiced “double extortion” against its victims — requiring one ransom payment for a key to unlock hijacked systems, and a separate payment in exchange for a promise to delete data stolen from its victims.</p>
<p>But Justice Department officials say LockBit never deleted its victim data, regardless of whether those organizations paid a ransom to keep the information from being published on LockBit’s victim shaming website. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/05/u-s-charges-russian-man-as-boss-of-lockbit-ransomware-group/#more-67380" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">→</span></a></p>

												<p>Virtual private networking (VPN) companies market their services as a way to prevent anyone from snooping on your Internet usage. But new research suggests this is a dangerous assumption when connecting to a VPN via an untrusted network, because attackers on the same network could force a target’s traffic off of the protection provided by their VPN without triggering any alerts to the user.</p>
<div id="attachment_67354" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-67354" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-67354" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tunnelvision.png" alt="" width="750" height="569"><p id="caption-attachment-67354" class="wp-caption-text">Image: Shutterstock.</p></div>
<p>When a device initially tries to connect to a network, it broadcasts a message to the entire local network stating that it is requesting an Internet address. Normally, the only system on the network that notices this request and replies is the router responsible for managing the network to which the user is trying to connect.</p>
<p>The machine on a network responsible for fielding these requests is called a <strong>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol</strong> (DHCP) server, which will issue time-based leases for IP addresses. The DHCP server also takes care of setting a specific local address — known as an <strong>Internet gateway</strong> — that all connecting systems will use as a primary route to the Web.</p>
<p>VPNs work by creating a virtual network interface that serves as an encrypted tunnel for communications. But researchers at <strong>Leviathan Security</strong> say they’ve discovered it’s possible to abuse an obscure feature built into the DHCP standard so that other users on the local network are forced to connect to a rogue DHCP server.</p>
<p>“Our technique is to run a DHCP server on the same network as a targeted VPN user and to also set our DHCP configuration to use itself as a gateway,” Leviathan researchers <strong>Lizzie Moratti</strong> and <strong>Dani Cronce</strong> wrote. “When the traffic hits our gateway, we use traffic forwarding rules on the DHCP server to pass traffic through to a legitimate gateway while we snoop on it.”</p>
<p>The feature being abused here is known as <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3442" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DHCP option 121</a>, and it allows a DHCP server to set a route on the VPN user’s system that is more specific than those used by most VPNs. Abusing this option, Leviathan found, effectively gives an attacker on the local network the ability to set up routing rules that have a higher priority than the routes for the virtual network interface that the target’s VPN creates.</p>
<p>“Pushing a route also means that the network traffic will be sent over the same interface as the DHCP server instead of the virtual network interface,” the Leviathan researchers said. “This is intended functionality that isn’t clearly stated in the RFC [standard]. Therefore, for the routes we push, it is never encrypted by the VPN’s virtual interface but instead transmitted by the network interface that is talking to the DHCP server. As an attacker, we can select which IP addresses go over the tunnel and which addresses go over the network interface talking to our DHCP server.”</p>
<p>Leviathan found they could force VPNs on the local network that already had a connection to arbitrarily request a new one. In this well-documented tactic, known as a <a href="https://www.prosec-networks.com/en/blog/dhcp-starvation-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DHCP starvation attack</a>, an attacker floods the DHCP server with requests that consume all available IP addresses that can be allocated. Once the network’s legitimate DHCP server is completely tied up, the attacker can then have their rogue DHCP server respond to all pending requests.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe loading="lazy" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ajsLmZia6UU?si=OYDck1VdGoLF0XFU" width="750" height="415" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p>“This technique can also be used against an already established VPN connection once the VPN user’s host needs to renew a lease from our DHCP server,” the researchers wrote. “We can artificially create that scenario by setting a short lease time in the DHCP lease, so the user updates their routing table more frequently. In addition, the VPN control channel is still intact because it already uses the physical interface for its communication. In our testing, the VPN always continued to report as connected, and the kill switch was never engaged to drop our VPN connection.”</p>
<p>The researchers say their methods could be used by an attacker who compromises a DHCP server or wireless access point, or by a rogue network administrator who owns the infrastructure themselves and maliciously configures it. Alternatively, an attacker could set up an “<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/evil-twin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evil twin</a>” wireless hotspot that mimics the signal broadcast by a legitimate provider.</p>
<h2>ANALYSIS</h2>
<p><strong>Bill Woodcock</strong> is executive director at <a href="http://www.pch.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Packet Clearing House</a>, a nonprofit based in San Francisco. Woodcock said Option 121 has been included in the DHCP standard since 2002, which means the attack described by Leviathan has technically been possible for the last 22 years.</p>
<p>“They’re realizing now that this can be used to circumvent a VPN in a way that’s really problematic, and they’re right,” Woodcock said.</p>
<p>Woodcock said anyone who might be a target of spear phishing attacks should be very concerned about using VPNs on an untrusted network.</p>
<p>“Anyone who is in a position of authority or maybe even someone who is just a high net worth individual, those are all very reasonable targets of this attack,” he said. “If I were trying to do an attack against someone at a relatively high security company and I knew where they typically get their coffee or sandwich at twice a week, this is a very effective tool in that toolbox. I’d be a little surprised if it wasn’t already being exploited in that way, because again this isn’t rocket science. It’s just thinking a little outside the box.” <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/05/why-your-vpn-may-not-be-as-secure-as-it-claims/#more-67184" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">→</span></a></p>
