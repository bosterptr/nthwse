        <h3>What makes qu.ax great?</h3>
        <section>
            There are many things that make our service great, we've list a few of them below.
            <ul>
                <li>We're pro-privacy, none of your images will be shared with anyone you haven't shared the link with. This includes an un-named antagonist in the file upload scene, who pesters us with requests to share your private content via internet archives.</li>
                <li>Virus free! We run a virus scan on our uploaded files every thirty minutes, making sure that your content is not on the same server as various viruses.</li>
                <li>Everything's here to stay. If your file does not break the rules listed below; we will not remove it without reason to. On that note, if you want your file removed, feel free to contact us.</li>
                <li>We keep no logs, neither logs for uploading nor for downloading. So if you're an aspiring Edward Snowden, nothing will lead back to you.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>What are the rules?</h3>
        <section>
            As with any file upload service, we've got to set some ground rules for what content can and can not be uploaded to our service. Below are some guidelines as to what we allow and do not allow.
            <ul>
                <li>We <strong>do not</strong> allow child pornography or beastiality of a real nature, and will actively remove it whenever it's discovered.</li>
                <li>
                    Viruses
                    <stong>are not allowed and should be taken care of by our automated virus scans. In the event that a virus is found by a means other than our automated virus scan, we will remove it.</stong>
                </li>
                <li>We do however, allow pornography to be uploaded to our server. Granted that it does not break any other rule. This includes, but is not limited to hentai and softcore porn.</li>
                <li>We can't allow illegal content. If it's illegal in any way to host your content, and we're notified about its existence, we have to remove it.</li>
                <li>As long as it doesn't break our rules, we don't mind what you upload.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>How can I upload to qu.ax without using the site?</h3>
        <section>
            Using the site can be a bit of a pain, thankfully you don't have to! There are numerous ways to use qu.ax, two of them are listed below.
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://getsharex.com/">ShareX</a> - qu.ax is built into ShareX by default (Just use https://qu.ax/upload.php as value in the pomf section under file uploaders) or use our <a href="https://qu.ax/static/quax.sxcu">custom-upload template file</a> to quickly add qu.ax to your ShareX destinations.
                </li><li>
                </li><li>Or just upload files directly from your shell via curl:
                <br><a href="https://curl.se/">curl</a> -i -F files[]=@yourfile.jpeg https://qu.ax/upload.php (JSON Response)
