<h3><a name="SECTION00010000000000000000">
Objectives</a>
</h3>

The short-term goal of the project is to determine the feasibility of building
a software-based framework to simulate a variety of industrial networks such as
SCADA, DCS, and PLC architectures. We plan to document the requirements and
release proof of concept code (in the form of <a href="http://www.honeyd.org">honeyd</a> scripts) so that a single Linux host
can simulate multiple industrial devices and complex network topologies.  Given
the variety of deployments and the lack of standard, well-defined architectures
for industrial networks, this project attempts to create the building blocks so
that users can simulate their networks own networks--not make assumptions about
what "real world" SCADA/DCS/PLC look like. Assuming deployment of "SCADA
HoneyNets" ever reach critical mass, the longer term objective of the project
is to gather information about general attack patterns and specific exploits
that could be used to write signature for commercial and Open Source IDS
products.


<p>

Introduction</a>
</h3>

There is still little information about SCADA vulnerabilities and attacks,
despite the growing awareness of security issues in industrial networks. As is
the case with IT security, owner-operators are often unwilling to release
attack or incident data. However, unlike IT products and protocols, there are
<b>not</b> the sort of public repositories of vendor advisories and
vulnerabilities in industrial devices. Although some vulnerability research is
being conducted in this area, very little has been released publically and no
"SCADA security tools" (whatever that might mean) have been released to the
public.

<p>
To address these limitations, this goal of this project is to provide tools and
to simulate a variety of industrial networks and devices. We see several uses for this project:

</p><ul>
<li>Build a HoneyNet for attackers, to gather data on attacker trends and
tools
</li>

<li>Provide a scriptable industrial protocol simulators to test a real live
protocol implementation </li> 

<li>Research countermeasures, such as device hardening, stack obfuscation,
reducing application information, and the effectiveness network access controls
</li> </ul>

<p>

</p><h3><a name="SECTION00030000000000000000">
Feature Requirements</a>
</h3>

Based on our knowledge of industrial network applications, products, and
protocols, we identified the following requirements:

<p>

</p><h4><a name="SECTION00031000000000000000">
Individual Device Simulation</a>
</h4>

To simulate individual devices, the following functionality is needed:

<p>
</p><ul>

<li><b>Stack level</b>: To simulate the TCP/IP stack of a Ethernet-based device
device to a script kiddie type attacker who is scanning the network with OS
detection tools such as Nmap and Xprobe.</li>

<li><b>Protocol level</b>: To simulate industrial protocols for skilled
attackers who have the tools which interrogate  protocols and want to do
something meaningful using the protocol features 

</li> <li><b>Application level</b>: To simulate various applications on a SCADA
device such as web servers and management applications such as SNMP and Telnet.
</li>

<li><b>Hardware level</b>:Many of the SCADA devices use serial interfaces such
as modems and RS232 interfaces for both SCADA protocol communication and for
management purposes.  An attacker who either "logs into" a SCADA device or has
access to the serial network, needs to be presented with a serial device and/or
a protocol communication over a serial device.  </li> </ul>

<p>

</p><h4><a name="SECTION00032000000000000000">

Simulate Network</a>
</h4>

We need to simulate various entry points so that when an attacker encounters a
perimeter device, he will be presented the same network as a real SCADA network
at that particular network entry point

<br>
Various network entry points that we need to simulate include:

<p>

</p><ol>

<li><b>A router directly connected to the Internet</b>: Control system networks are typically not directly conne 
a control network is located inside a corporate network.  Assuming 
the corporate network as Internet, we need to simulate the entry 
point of a router that seperates the control network and the 
corporate network.  The devices that are normally connected to 
such routers would be Industrial Ethernet switches or industrial 
devices with an IP stack, such as some IP enabled PLCs and wireless 
access points.
</li>

<li><b>Direct serial device</b>:Some of the industrial devices 
have a modem that can be directly dialed into from a PSTN.  We 
need to simulate a "modem server" that can take connections and 
behaves like a industrial device or is connected to a industrial 
device.
</li>

<li><b>A Ethernet enabled industrial device directly connected 
to the Internet</b>: Such a scenario should be the same as simulating 
the stack, the protocols and applications on that device and connecting 
that to Internet

</li>
<li><b>An Ethernet serial gateway directly plugged into the 
Internet</b>:An Ethernet serial gateway is a bridge between the IP 
network and the serial interface.  The IP side of the device 
would be connected to the network, either a Industrial switch or 
a router to which other IP industrial devices are connected to.  
The serial side of the device would be connected to a serial device 
or a serial network.
</li>

<li><b>Wireless</b>: Wireless is one of the entry points into a 
Industrial network.  Most of the Industrial wireless devices use 
proprietary wireless protocols and some of them use 802.1b standard.  
Typically the serial interface of the device would be connected to a 
wireless bridge.  
</li>

<li><b>Remote desktop access and HMIs</b>:The Human Machine Interfaces 
and the software that communicates with Industrial devices usually run
on a Windows machine.  Administrators who want remote access to these 
devices would typically run a remote desktop viewer, such as VNC or 
PC anywhere.  An attacker would normally find it through a port scan '
after he gets into the control network and might get to it using a 
VNC client.  Simulating this would probably need a custom made VNC 
protocol simulation.
</li>

<li><b>Remote Access Server (RAS)</b>:Another possible entry point into a
control network is to dial into the network using PPP and use the PPP password
to authenticate yourself to a Network Access Server and then directly access
the Industrial device.  </li> </ol>

<p>

</p><h4><a name="SECTION00033000000000000000">
Capture the attacker tools and tracks</a>
</h4>

Our scripts need to capture the attacker tools and tracks.  That 
should include keystroke logging and facilities to capture the 
tools and binaries he might be up loading, if the attack.  Our scripts also need 
to capture network traffic.

<p>

Review of existing technologies and relavency</a>
</h3>

<p>

</p><h4><a name="SECTION00041000000000000000">
Honeyd</a>
</h4>

Honeyd has facilities for easy simulation of TCP/IP stacks
and applications.

<br>
Honeynet takes Nmap and Xprobe signatures through configuration 
files and sends packet responses to scans matching those signatures.  
Users can set up profiles, mapping IP addresses that Honeyd should 
respond to a corresponding device profile.  When attackers Nmap or 
Xprobe scan the IP address which Honeyd is taking care of, he will 
be returned with packets matching the corresponding device profile.

<p>
Therefore using Honeyd, it would be possible to simultaneously 
simulate stacks of multiple IP based Industrial devices, provided 
the corresponding scanning tools (Nmap or Xprobe) has the knowledge 
of the signature.  As of now, there are no signatures of Industrial 
devices in Nmap's database.

<br>
Honeyd allows the user to listen on a port and run a script on that 
particular port when anybody connects to that port.  As of now, there 
are many scripts contributed to the project, which can simulate web 
pages, WSFTP servers and Cisco telnet servers.

</p><p>

Using this feature on Honeyd, it is possible to write scripts that simulated
various Industrial Ethernet protocols. For example, it would be possible to
simulate a Modbus/TCP server on port 502 and EtherNet/IP on ports 44818/2222.

</p><p>

</p><h4><a name="SECTION00042000000000000000">
Serial interface simulation</a>
</h4>

Many industrial network devices use RS-232/485 for communication.  Typically
the serial port of a PC would be directly (or indirectly, via a serial Ethernet
gateway) connected to the serial port of the device.  There would be a software
running on the PC, which sends commands to the device over the serial
interface. By some accounts there are hundreds of serial protocols in use in
SCADA networks. Some of the more common protocols are MODBUS and DNP.


<p>
We need to simulate those protocols over the serial port, so as to present a
protocol interface to an attacker who connects to the serial port. Many
languages support serial interface programming including Python and Java.  We
were able to achieve serial communication through a open source Python serial
programming module (<a href="http://pyserial.sf.net">pyserial.sf.net</a>).

</p><p>

</p><h4><a name="SECTION00044000000000000000">
Simulating 802.11</a>
</h4>
The HostAP driver(http://hostap.epitest.fi/), replies for 802.1b 
management packets and converts a client adapter an access point.
The driver can be used to simulate an access point which is inside
a automation or a SCADA network

<h3><a name="SECTION00043000000000000000">
Capturing attack tools and capturing the attackers' track</a>
</h3>

Though not part of Honeyd, there are lots of keystroke loggers available.  We
need a mechanism to track the attacker on the web interface of the device.  We
do not know of any tools which can provide that functionality, however we
explored some possibilities where the the Java applet (running on the
"attackers" web browser) is able to comm

Challenges</a>
</h3>

<p>

</p><h4><a name="SECTION00051000000000000000">
Deployment and Testing</a>
</h4>

An ideal deployment site for such a script would be a subnet close 
to a real Industrial/SCADA network or a phone number which belongs 
to a SCADA/Automation plant.  We are not aware of any active and 
on-going SCADA specific attacks, it would be difficult to get a 
SCADA aware attacker into the honeypot.
