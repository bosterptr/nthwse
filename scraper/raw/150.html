<meta name="description" content="During a forensic investigation, Windows Event Logs are the primary source of evidence.Windows Event Log analysis can help an investigator draw a timeline based on the logging information and the discovered artifacts, but a deep knowledge of events IDs is mandatory. According to the version of Windows installed on the system under investigation, the number and types of events will differ, so the events logged by a Windows XP machine may be incompatible with an event log analysis tool designed for Windows 8. For example, Event ID 551 on a Windows XP machine refers to a logoff event; the Windows 7 equivalent is Event ID 4647. Old Windows events can be converted to new events by adding 4096 to the Event ID. Windows versions since Vista include a number of new events that are not logged by Windows XP systems, and Windows Server editions have larger numbers and types of events. Below the event list that I use in my day-by-day investigations, hope may be useful!

<meta property="og:description" content="During a forensic investigation, Windows Event Logs are the primary source of evidence.Windows Event Log analysis can help an investigator draw a timeline based on the logging information and the discovered artifacts, but a deep knowledge of events IDs is mandatory. According to the version of Windows installed on the system under investigation, the number and types of events will differ, so the events logged by a Windows XP machine may be incompatible with an event log analysis tool designed for Windows 8. For example, Event ID 551 on a Windows XP machine refers to a logoff event; the Windows 7 equivalent is Event ID 4647. Old Windows events can be converted to new events by adding 4096 to the Event ID. Windows versions since Vista include a number of new events that are not logged by Windows XP systems, and Windows Server editions have larger numbers and types of events. Below the event list that I use in my day-by-day investigations, hope may be useful!

According to the version of Windows installed on the system under investigation, the number and types of events will differ, so the events logged by a Windows XP machine may be incompatible with an event log analysis tool designed for Windows 8. For example, Event ID 551 on a Windows XP machine refers to a logoff event; the Windows 7 equivalent is Event ID 4647. Old Windows events can be converted to new events by adding 4096 to the Event ID. Windows versions since Vista include a number of new events that are not logged by Windows XP systems, and Windows Server editions have larger numbers and types of events. Below the event list that I use in my day-by-day investigations, hope may be useful!

<p>During a forensic investigation, Windows Event Logs are the primary source of evidence.<br>Windows Event Log analysis can help an investigator draw a timeline based on the logging information and the discovered artifacts, but a deep knowledge of events IDs is mandatory.</p>
<p></p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>According to the version of <strong>Windows</strong> installed on the system under investigation, the number and types of events will differ, so the events logged by a <strong>Windows XP </strong>machine may be incompatible with an event log analysis tool designed for <strong>Windows 8</strong>.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>For example, Event ID <strong>551</strong> on a <strong>Windows XP </strong>machine refers to a logoff event; the <strong>Windows 7</strong> equivalent is Event ID 4647.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Old Windows events can be converted to new events by adding 4096 to the Event ID.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Windows</strong> versions since <strong>Vista</strong> include a number of new events that are not logged by <strong>Windows XP</strong> systems, and <strong>Windows Server</strong> editions have larger numbers and types of events.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Below the event list that I use in my day-by-day investigations, hope may be useful! </p>
